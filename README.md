Chronic Disease Indicators Analysis
This project analyzes CDC Chronic Disease Indicators data to uncover important health trends across different regions.
Using Python(Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn) we performed deep data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to highlight patterns in chronic diseases like diabetes, obesity, and asthma.

Key Highlights
Cleaned and organized raw health data.
Performed EDA to find trends, correlations, and insights.
Created clear and easy-to-understand charts and graphs.
Built a strong base for future prediction models and dashboards.

Tools Used
Python
pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)

Future Scope
Build real-time health dashboards.
Predict future disease trends using machine learning.
Combine with environmental and socioeconomic data for deeper insights.
